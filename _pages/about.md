Hello! I'm currently a Biostatistician at the [Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network Coordinating Center](https://www.cff.org/Research/Researcher-Resources/Therapeutics-Development-Network/Working-with-the-TDN/Introduction-to-the-Therapeutics-Development-Network/), supported by the [Cystic Fibrosis Foundation](https://www.cff.org/) and housed at the [Seattle Childrenâ€™s Research Institute](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/).

I completed my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the [University of Washington](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) (UW), under the guidance of [Dr. Adam Szpiro](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/adamszpiro/home). My doctoral dissertation was motivated by statistical challenges arising in modeling environmental exposures, particularly in air pollution studies. My research focus on developing statistical methods to effectively handle spatially-misaligned multivariate data with missing observations. 

During my doctoral training, I also worked as a Research Assistant at the [Center for Biomedical Statistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/research/centers/cbs) (CBS), under the guidance of [Dr. Patrick Heagerty](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/patrick-heagerty) and [Bryan Comstock](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/user/37). The CBS offers consulting and data coordinating services to UW scientists and investigators whose research focus on improving patient care and clinical practices. 

I am broadly interested in statistical modeling, methods for high-dimensional data, and analysis of correlated data. My work is often motivated by applications in environmental epidemiology, public health, and clinical research.
